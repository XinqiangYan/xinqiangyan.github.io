My research pursuits revolve around advancing engineering solutions to address the technical challenges encountered in the field of MRI. My primary objectives encompass improving RF and B0 homogeneity in high-field MRI, accelerating acquisition speed, reducing RF heating near implants, and enhancing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio.


Our current research projects include: 1. Solving dark bands in tcMRgFUS using passive reflective antennas;  2. Developing next-generation integrated RF Tx/Rx and B0 shimming coils for 7T brain and spinal cord MRI;  3. Developing flexible RF coils and baluns;  4. Developing RF-transparent B0 shimming coil array;  5. Implementing low-cost wireless coils for clinical scanners;  6. Developing novel materials and devices to reduce RF-related heating near MRI implants.
