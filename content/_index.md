        Yan Lab focuses on developing innovative engineering solutions for technical challenges in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI-guided therapies. The lab's key research areas include improving RF and B0 homogeneity, reducing RF heating near implants, alleviating motion-related artifacts, accelerating acquisition speeds, and enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio for MRI systems, as well as developing portable MRI scanners and MRI-guided therapy systems. Dr. Yan has led multiple NIH-funded projects and invented groundbreaking devices, such as the self-decoupled coil and the RF-transparent B0 shimming coil, which have significantly advanced MRI technologies and clinical applications. The lab currently includes research staff scientists, postdocs, PhD students, and several undergraduate students.
